%%% Algorithm for generating unique cite keys
%%%

%% Specify a new format type so we use the van part of the name, too
new.format.type = {2 = "%*v"}

%% Clear the et al generated part of the name
fmt.et.al = {}

%% Expand macros
key.expand.macros = on

%% For identical keys, add a lower case letter with no separator
key.base = lower
key.number.separator = {}

%% Follow these steps for generating the keys:
%% 	(i) 	if the entry type is @xdata, keep the cite key that the user supplied
%% 	(ii) 	otherwise, if the data field asdf was specified, use its content as the cite key
%%			NB: this allows the user to overwrite what bibtool would generate if bibtool
%%				would do something stupid otherwise; if it would do something stupid, feel
%%				free to open a GitHub issue and/or submit a pull request that modifies this script
%%	(iii) 	otherwise:
%%			(a) if there is a van part of the last name for the first author, use the lowercase
%%				version of it; if not, don't print anything, and, in either case, print the
%%				lowercased version of the author's last name
%%				NB: if the first author has more than one last name, they will all be printed, 
%%				separated with a '-'
%%			(b) if there is no author, do this for the editor instead
%%			(c) then, add the first four digits from the date field and a colon if the date field
%%				exists; if it doesn't, just add a colon
%%			(d) then, if the field xkcd is specified, add its lowercased content after the colon;
%%				otherwise, add the first not ignored word from the title field and make it lowercase
%%				NB: the user can provide something to put after the year and colon by specifying
%%					something in the xkcd field in case the first not ignored word of the title field
%%					isn't really all that informative; feel free to suggest a new word for this script
%%					to ignore by either opening a GitHub issue or submitting a pull request
%%	(iv) otherwise, return '???' as the cite key; if this happens to you, please open a GitHub issue
